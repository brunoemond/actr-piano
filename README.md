# actr-piano
Resources to add to ACT-R for modelling piano learning and performance.

The code is divided in two main directories. The "user-loads" directory has files that should be copied to the ACT-R user-loads directory either for the ACT-R environment or any Common Lisp running the ACT-R source code. 

The "models" directory contains example models that could be loaded by the cognitive modeler and are not required to be located in a specific directory.
