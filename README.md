# actr-piano
ACT-R Resources for modelling piano learning and performance.

The code is divided in two main directories. The "user-loads" directory has files that should be copied to the ACT-R "user-loads" directory either for the ACT-R environment or any Common Lisp running the ACT-R source code. 

The file "actr-piano-files.lisp" is responsible to load the specific files from the "actr-piano-files" directory.
